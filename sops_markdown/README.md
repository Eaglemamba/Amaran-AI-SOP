# SOPs (Markdown)

Converted SOP files in Markdown format, ready for upload to Gemini context window or Claude Project.

All files here have been:
1. Converted from Word/PDF using the `sop_to_markdown.py` pipeline
2. Desensitized using `amaran_redact.py` (client names, batch numbers, pricing stripped)
3. QA-validated for zero data leakage

Do NOT place raw/unconverted SOPs here. Do NOT place SOPs that have not been desensitized.
