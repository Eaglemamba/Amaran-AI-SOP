# Future: Requires Separate Evaluation

**Timeline:** Month 6+ | 2026-08-03 onwards
**Scope:** 1 application
**Status:** Not started (requires internal system maturity + governance completion)

External-facing systems have a fundamentally different risk profile.
Do not build until the internal system is proven and governance documentation is complete.

## Contents

### `customer_service_bot/`
**App #16: Customer Service Bot** | 4-8 weeks | High complexity
- External-facing chatbot
- Different risk profile: IT security review, legal approval, separate infrastructure
- Not recommended until internal system is mature
- May need more formal governance (possibly full GAMP if it touches customer-facing quality claims)
